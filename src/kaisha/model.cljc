;; A DM is a channel with `:kaisha/kind :dm`, `:private` visibility and exactly
;; two members. It is not a separate collection: threads, reactions, read
;; markers, mentions and validation all apply unchanged, and a host that can
;; render a private channel can render a DM.
;;
;; THE ID IS DERIVED, NOT ALLOCATED. That is the whole design. If each side
;; allocated a fresh id when it opened a conversation, two people messaging each
;; other at the same time would create two DM channels for the same pair, with
;; the history split between them and nothing anywhere detecting it — each
;; client would show a conversation that looks complete and is missing half the
;; messages. Deriving the id from the (sorted) pair makes that state
;; unrepresentable: both sides compute the same id without coordinating, and
;; `open-dm` is idempotent.
