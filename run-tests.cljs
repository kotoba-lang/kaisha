;; Two-runtime gate: the same suite under nbb (ClojureScript on Node), not just
;; the JVM.
;;
;; This repo needed one. `kaisha.model` is consumed in a Cloudflare Worker —
;; `cloud-itonami.edge.chat-store` persists a space with it — so ClojureScript
;; is a production runtime here, not a hypothetical one, and until now nothing
;; ran the suite there. The JVM and ClojureScript disagree about things that
;; pure-looking code walks into (integer vs double arithmetic; evaluation order
;; of a map literal's values once it becomes a hash-map), and a suite that only
;; runs on one of them is green for a reason unrelated to correctness.
;; `90-docs/adr/2607300500` records two such traps found exactly this way.
;;
;; Run:
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test" run-tests.cljs

;; cljs.test prints its own summary; this hook exists only so a failure becomes
;; a non-zero exit code, which is what a CI gate reads.
